The band_analysis_cython function determines the band analysis of materials
by tallying the frequency points which satisfy the threshold, and summing
the span of their frequencies.

::

    :param PnPgrid:     (data)

PnPgrid is a pre-processed permittivity & permeability array passed from
libRL.CARL of shape Nx5 of [freq, e1, e2, mu1, mu2].

::

    :param mGrid:       (array)

mGrid is a numpy array of d_values calculated from a modified
quarter-wavelength function determined from the frequency values of the
PnPgrid.

::

    :param m_set:       m_set

m_set is a numpy array of bands passed through from
libRL.refactoring.m_set_ref()

::

    :param d_set:       d_set

d_set is a numpy array of thickness values passed through from
libRL.refactoring.d_set_ref()

::

    :param thrs:        thrs

thrs is the threshold value to test Reflection loss against for each (f, d)
point in the response field, passed through directly from
libRL.band_analysis()

::

    :return:            res

returns a NxM array of the N thicknesses along band M which respond have
reflection loss values below the threshold.

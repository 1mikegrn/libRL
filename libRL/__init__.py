libRL
=====

libRL is a library of functions used for characterizing Microwave Absorption.

functions include:

    libRL.RL(
    Mcalc=None, f_set=None, d_set=None, **kwargs
    )
        - resultants of Reflection Loss over (f, d) gridspace. Yields the
        resulting Reflection Loss results for a given set of permittivity
        and permeability data.
        see libRL.RL? for complete documentation.

    libRL.CARL(
    Mcalc=None, f_set=None, params="All", **kwargs
    )
        - characterization of Reflection Loss. Yields the calculated results
        of common formulations within the Radar Absorbing Materials field.
        see libRL.CARL? for complete documentation.

    libRL.BARF(
    Mcalc=None, f_set=None, d_set=None, m_set=None, threshold=-10, **kwargs
    )
        - Band Analysis of Reflection Loss. Uses given set of permittivity and
        permeability data in conjuncture with a requested band set to determine
        the set of frequencies with are below a threshold.
        see libRL.BARF? for complete documentation.

    the RL function calculates the Reflection Loss based on the mapping
    passed through as the grid variable, done either through multiprocessing
    or through the python built-in map() function. The RL function always
    uses the interpolation function, even though as the function passes
    through the points associated with the input data, solving for the
    function at the associated frequencies yields the data point. This
    is simply for simplicity.

                    tuple for frequency values in GHz

                    ------------------------------

    :param kwargs:  :interp=:
                    ('cubic'); 'linear'

                    Method for interpolation. Set to linear if user wants to
                    linear interp instead of cubic spline. Default action
                    uses cubic spline.
                    ------------------------------

                    :override=:
                    (None); 'chi zero'; 'edp zero'; 'eps set'

                    provides response simulation functionality within libRL,
                    common for discerning which EM parameters are casual for
                    reflection loss. 'chi zero' sets mu = (1 - j*0). 'eps set'
                    sets epsilon = (avg(e1)-j*0).
                    ------------------------------

                    :multiprocessing=:
                    (False); True; 0; 1; 2; ...

                    Method for activating multiprocessing functionality for
                    faster run times. This **kwarg takes integers and booleans.
                    Set variable to True or 0 to use all available nodes. Pass
                    an integer value to use (int) nodes. Will properly handle
                    'False' as an input though it's equivalent to not even
                    designating the particular **kwarg.

                    NOTE: if you use the multiprocessing functionality herein
                    while on a Windows computer you ***MUST MUST MUST MUST***
                    provide main module protection via the
                    if __name__ == "__main__":
                    conditional so to negate infinite spawns.

                    :quick_graph=:
                    (False); True, str()

                    saves a *.png graphical image to a specified location. If
                    set to True, the quick_graph function saves the resulting
                    graphical image to the location of the input data as
                    defined by the Mcalc input (assuming that the data was
                    input via a location string. If not, True throws an
                    assertion error). The raw string of a file location can
                    also be passed as the str() argument, if utilized then the
                    function will save the graph at the specified location.

                    :as_dataframe=:
                    (False); True

                    returns data in a pandas dataframe. This is particularly
                    useful if multicolumn is also set to true.
                    ------------------------------

                    :multicolumn=:
                    (False); True

                    outputs data in multicolumn form with  a numpy array of
                    [RL, f, d] iterated over each of the three columns.
                    - or -
                    if as_dataframe is used, then return value will be a pandas
                    dataframe with columns of name d and indexes of name f.
                    ------------------------------


    :return:        returns Nx3 data set of [RL, f, d] by default

    """

    the BARF (Band Analysis for ReFlection loss) function uses Permittivity
    and Permeability data of materials so to determine the effective bandwidth
    of Reflection Loss. The effective bandwidth is the span of frequencies
    where the reflection loss is below some proficiency threshold (standard
    threshold is -10 dB). Program is computationally taxing; thus, efforts
    were made to push most of the computation to the C-level for faster run
    times - the blueprints for such are included in the cpfuncs.pyx file,
    which was compiled via Cython and the cython_setup.py file.

    :param Mcalc:   (data)

                    Permittivity and Permeability data of Nx5 dimensions.
                    Can be a string equivalent to the directory and file
                    name of either a .csv or .xlsx of Nx5 dimensions. Text
                    above and below data array will be automatically
                    avoided by the program (most network analysis instruments
                    report data which is compatible with the required format)

    :param f_set:   (start, end, [step])

                    tuple for frequency values in GHz
                    - or -
                    - if given as tuple of len 3, results are interpolated
                    - if given as tuple of len 2, results are data-derived
                    with the calculation bound by the given start and end
                    frequencies from the tuple
                    - is given as int or float of len 1, results are
                    interpolated over the entire data set with a step size
                    of the given tuple value.
                    - if f_set is None (default), frequency is bound to
                    input data.

    :param d_set:   (start, end, [step])

                    tuple for thickness values in mm.
                    - or -
                    - if d_set is of type list, then the thickness values
                    calculated will only be of the values present in the
                    list. (is weird, but whatever.)

    :param m_set:   (start, end, [step])

                    tuple of ints which define the bands to be calculated.
                    - or -
                    - if m_set is given as a list [], the explicitly listed
                    band integers will be calculated.

    :param thrs:    -10

                    Threshold for evaluation. If RL values are below this
                    threshold value, the point is counted for the band.
                    Default value is -10.

    :param kwargs:  :override=:
                    (None); 'chi zero'; 'edp zero'; 'eps set'

                    provides response simulation functionality within libRL,
                    common for discerning which EM parameters are casual for
                    reflection loss. 'chi zero' sets mu = (1 - j*0). 'eps set'
                    sets epsilon = (avg(e1)-j*0).
                    ------------------------------

                    :interp=:
                    'linear'; 'cubic'

                    Method for interpolation. Set to linear if user wants to
                    linear interp instead of cubic spline.
                    ------------------------------

                    :quick_graph=:
                    (False); True, str()

                    saves a *.png graphical image to a specified location. If
                    set to True, the quick_graph function saves the resulting
                    graphical image to the location of the input data as
                    defined by the Mcalc input (assuming that the data was
                    input via a location string. If not, True throws an
                    assertion error). The raw string of a file location can
                    also be passed as the str() argument, if utilized then the
                    function will save the graph at the specified location.
                    ------------------------------

                    :as_dataframe=:
                    True; False

                    Formats results into a pandas
                    dataframe with the index labels as the thickness
                    values, the column labels as the band numbers, and
                    the dataframe as the resulting effective bandwidths.
                    ------------------------------


    :return:        returns len(3) tuple with [d_set, band_results, m_set].
                    the rows of the band_results correspond with the d_set and
                    the columns of the band_results correspond with the m_set.
                    - or -
                    returns the requested dataframe with the band values as
                    column headers and the thickness values as row headers.

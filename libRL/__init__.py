===================

libRL is a library of functions used for characterizing Microwave Absorption.

functions include:

::

    libRL.reflection_loss(
    data=None, f_set=None, d_set=None, **kwargs
    )

resultants of Reflection Loss over (f, d) gridspace. Yields the
resulting Reflection Loss results for a given set of permittivity
and permeability data.
see the DocStrings for complete documentation.

::

    libRL.characterization(
    data=None, f_set=None, params="all", **kwargs
    )

characterization of Reflection Loss. Yields the calculated results
of common formulations within the Radar Absorbing Materials field.
see the DocStrings for complete documentation.

::

    libRL.band_analysis(
    data=None, f_set=None, d_set=None, m_set=None, threshold=-10, **kwargs
    )

Band Analysis of Reflection Loss. uses given set of permittivity and
permeability data in conjuncture with a requested band set to determine
the set of frequencies whose reflection losses are below the
threshold.
see the DocStrings for complete documentation.

Developed at the University of Missouri-Kansas City under NSF grant DMR-1609061
by Michael Green and Xiaobo Chen.

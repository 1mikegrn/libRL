Getting Started
===============

If you're new to Python, an easy way to get started is through the
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ distribution.
Installation instructions for the three major operating systems can be found
in the JCE-Supplemental for `pyGC <https://github.com/1mikegrn/pyGC>`_

From your command prompt, the latest version of the libRL library can be installed via pip and git

:code:`pip install git+https://github.com/1mikegrn/libRL@v1.1.2`

Where the setup file will automatically check dependencies and install
to the main module library. Once installed, simply import the module as
normal via :code:`import libRL`, and query the docstring via libRL? - the
docstring includes a list of the available functions for use.

The library includes the following main-level functions:

::

    libRL.reflection_loss(
    data=None, f_set=None, d_set=None, **kwargs
    )

:func:`libRL.src.reflection_loss.reflection_loss` computes the resultants of Reflection Loss
over (f, d) gridspace.

::

    libRL.characterization(
    data=None, f_set=None, params="all", **kwargs
    )

:func:`libRL.src.characterization.characterization` yields the calculated results of common
formulations within the Radar Absorbing Materials field.

::

    libRL.band_analysis(
    data=None, f_set=None, d_set=None, m_set=None, threshold=-10, **kwargs
    )

:func:`libRL.src.band_analysis.band_analysis` uses given set of permittivity and permeability data
in conjuncture with a requested band set to determine the set of frequencies
whose reflection losses are below the threshold.

        __init__.py                         # initial executable
        src/
            reflection_loss.py              # reflection loss protocol
            characterization.py             # characterization protocol
            band_analysis.py                # band anaylsis protocol
            quarter_wave.py                 # quareter wave protocol
            f_peak.py                       # f_peak protocol

                pyfuncs.py                  # python fall-back form cpfuncs
                refactoring.py              # Data processing protocols
                quick_graphs.py             # data visualization protocols

the main libRL functions are all accessible via the modules
:code:`__init__.py` method, which are called directly from libRL.
